### High definition map development for Autonomous vehicles

The main task for mapping is to generate proper prior representation of environments. Generally, the HD Map should contain the following parts

- 1st layer: points map
- 2nd layer: lane markings and road boundaries
- 3rd layer: Lights and traffic signs
- 4th layer: 3D building models
- 5th layer: high confidence routes

MapLocalization is an open source ROS package for high definition map generation for autonomous driving. It firstly generate the points map using sensor information from LiDAR, INS (optional) and GNSS. Then the other road information is also added into the high definition map. In this package, points map is generated using LiDAR and GNSS (ENU) based on graph optimization. The example map is generated in El cerrito, Berkeley, California, USA. The next step is to generate.

## Spec Recommendation

- Number of CPU cores: 4
- RAM size: 16GB or larger
- Storage size: 30GB in SSD

## Requirements

- ROS jade (Ubuntu 14.04)
- Qt 5.2.1 or higher

### Install dependencies for Ubuntu 14.04 jade

install all the dependency when needed



## How to Build

```
$ cd $HOME
$ mkdir AMSI/src
$ cd AMSI/src
$ git clone ...
$ catkin_init_workspace
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make
```

## How to Start
### points map generation

```
roslaunch hdl_graph_slam hdl_graph_slam_400.launch

```

The subscribed topics are /points_raw and /nmea_sentence. please be noted: To transform the LiDAR coordinate system into ENU. please modify the "68.5 " value in the file hdl_graph_slam_nodelet.cpp at line 278

```
double theta = (68.5 )*( 3.141592 / 180.0 ); 

```

### Load 3D building models

The 3D building models are saved in kml file, then parsed into ENU with given reference point.

```
roslaunch amsi loadBuildingModels.launch

```

### Load road boundaries and lane markings

The 3D building models are saved in kml file, then parsed into ENU with given reference point.

```
roslaunch amsi loadLandMarkingsAndBoundaries.launch

```


## How to use this for your data
